__label__0 "the fit is gorgeous but i did n't realize it was completely transparent . when it says mesh it means mesh ! i was thinking the mesh part was on the bottom . because of how it is cut high on the shoulders you ca n't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage . very cute but not practical ."

__label__0 "i tried this on in the store - i tried regular medium which was way too big except in the chest where it was really tight . the material was a little itchy on me ( but maybe its because the chest was tight ) . the color is lovely ( pink ) . im sure someone will love it but if you are petite i would order the petite and maybe size up if you are busty ."
__label__1 "i bought this dress because it looked sooo comfy . and it is ! the fabric feels nice and it fits loose without feeling like a burlap sack . it 's perfect for running around town for errands . i actually did n't think my boyfriend would like it because he generally likes more form-fitting pieces ( yes big surprise ) but he actually commented out of the blue that it 's really sexy . comfy * and * sexy ? ! score !"

__label__0 "i expected better from this top it is thin will snack easy and you have to wear a cami underneath . for the price not worth it . definitely returned !"
__label__0 "this blouse is gorgeous but as other reviewers have noted it runs small and it 's very thin . the back is see-through not the front though if you tend to wear things a little large and order up a size the back is fine . my real issue is that it shrank so much when i washed it ( on cold delicate cycle hang dry ) that it 's pretty much unwearable now . sad ."
__label__0 "this top is beautiful but beware there is a lot of extra material on the sides . it was not flattering on only because of all the excess fabric . clearly the model in the picture has it pinned behind her . it would be a keeper if it was cut closer to the body but sadly it 's going back ."
__label__-1 "these pants were wonderful ... for 2 seasons . yes for almost $ 200 a pop they do n't even last a full year ! loved them so much i bit the bullet & bought 4 pair . all 4 started to rip in the same spot ! i tried to contact ag directly & they do not back up their products after 30 days . fortunately retailer was wonderful ( as always ! ) i will buy pilcro from now on - much better product for the money ."
__label__1 "this is ruching done right ! i tried this dress on and the two other women who saw me in it went to try it on as well . it is fitted but comfortable and because it is well cut the ruching hides a multitude of sins to leave you looking sleek and curvy in all the right places . it is also a versatile layering piece and would look great with almost anything . so unless this particular color is your nemesis this dress is a winner !"
__label__0 "cute . i love the button back detail . but it 's completely see-through . i could have worked with that by putting a cami underneath but the arm holes were too tight . did n't look bad just felt uncomfortable . you ca n't really tell in the pic but there 's elastic on the arm holes . it 'll work if you have super skinny arms but apparently i do n't ."

__label__-1 "i loved this shirt ! flattering and pretty . it 's hand wash only or dry clean . i hand washed it and the blue t-shirt part of the shirt shrank and now the front of the shirt is too short for me . would not recommend due to shrinkage ... too bad ."

__label__0 "i bought the stained glass top/bottoms . the print is very pretty . however the tankini top itself is not well-made . the front of it ( chest area ) turns out so that you can see part of the inside of the suit ( which is white ) . it does n't lay flat around the top and so it shows more of your chest on one side . for the price i do n't think it is worth it . i do n't like to wear it because it makes me feel uncomfortable ."
__label__0 "these pants are cute . they seem to me to have a wider leg than appears on the model . they do run big so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt . these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down but unfortunately look pretty sloppy by the end of the day as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly . since they already run a bit big this is a major negative . i wore them to church and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home . by late afternoon they looked like a different pair of pants ."
__label__0 "i nearly always wear a size small and sometimes even a small is too large . not in this case ; this top is extremely snug . i would not be able to wear this and i would 've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me . in the online photo . the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow . i 'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag . but that 's just conjecture ."
__label__1 "i am usually a small sometimes medium . purchased a small and want to wear it off the shoulder but it is too tight and the fabric is scratchy . it is a crepe fabric and although beautiful the hand of the material is not for me . confused if i should return or get a medium as the look is very cool . i wish this had been linen or some more natural material but still recommend it as a good buy"

__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress ! i ordered it when there was a 20 percent off special and could n't wait to get it . the colors are as depicted and the dress fit true to size . i also liked that it was n't too short . what i didnt like was that the dress is lined in white which you can plainly see in the picture but i didnt notice before ordering . i just think it would have been much prettier lined in black . im disappointed and the dress is going back ."
__label__0 "the skirt in person is not like the picture . baggy and runs large . i wear jean size 25 and the xs is two size too loose . there 's no pocket which is surprising on a denim . the slit in front makes the skirt look even loose no shape near what 's in the picture . and there 's no petite sizes . i am going to return it ."

__label__-1 "it is a beautiful top but runs huge ! ! ! i followed other reviews and ordered a size down hoping it would work but it was totally unflattering ! i wanted so bad to love it but there was no way i could keep it ! !"
__label__-1 "the shirt is beautiful but fits much too small . the stitching limits the space in your shoulders and the hem too short . a petite frame would be able to pull this off- but i am a 5.10 medium and the shirt did n't work in every direction ."
__label__1 "very versatile dress . runs a bit large i am 5 foot 2 ( 105 lbs ) and ordered the xs petite and it fit perfectly !"
__label__-1 "i ordered this since it looked so cute on the model . when i it arrived i was excited to try it on but when i did ... blah . the color is murky and the top runs large not to mention that the material is too heavy for a short sleeved top ( plus it 's lined ) . i really wanted to like it and debated wetting it and then putting it in the dryer to shrink it a bit . in the end i decided that it was n't worth it . too bad as the concept was a good one . it just failed in the execution ."
__label__-1 "i really love the idea behind this . however the fit does n't work for me . i 'm usually a s or xs in retailer tops and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops . this one runs small though - the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width . the neckline was very high ( higher than it looks in the model photo ) and the armholes were too big . so i do n't think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue . the other criticism is that the front is not lined ."
__label__1 "these pants are beautiful and so comfortable . the liner is a nice surprise . they can be casual or dressed up with a jacket . i 'm so pleased to have gotten them on sale !"
__label__0 "love the style and fit but it does stretch out during wear . by the end of the day it feels big ."
__label__-1 "i love the photo of this and because the reviews were so positive i ordered it . i was shocked when i opened the package . first the fabric is not the silky rayon cotton blend i was expecting . it looks and feels more like a cheap cotton . it does not have the drape or feel or look i expect in a kimono which brings me to the second disappointment . it is not a kimono at all . it has no kimono sleeve no sleeves at all in fact . just a slit in the side of the body of the garment you put your arm throu"
__label__0 "i ordered this after seeing the rave reviews . it is not for me . just like the culottes i ordered this romper makes me feel like a grandma . i said i 'd recommend to others bc of the other reviews but again this was not for me . i also did n't like the back of the romper . no way i could even get away with a racerback bra b/c it 's so low cut . the good though- it is super comfortable and is a nice heavy fabric . tts also . i 'm a med 8/10 and the medium was correct in this ."
__label__-1 "the fit on this shirt is bizarre -- it very much resembles a nursing top ( but would n't actually work for that purpose ) . the side visible in the picture is nicely draped but the other side can flap open and is completely different . i tried two different sizes and both were equally unfortunate !"
__label__1 "these jeans are well-made the cut is decently flattering but on more muscular thighs it would look nicer if the cuff was a bit higher . the petite on me was just below the ankle so it just looks like i folded my jeans because they were too long . if you are taller or have longer legs ( mine are short on my short height ) then i think these would be great . i dind't find them particularly small but htey were snug ( muscular thighs ) . overall ok but returning them . ( 25 p ordered 115 lbs 26.5 in"
__label__0 "received this dress the sleeves are very pretty the drape was just what i was looking for but the overall dress was not very flattering on me . i am a little busty on top so it pulled in a unflattering way . i would say that if you are tall and not on the busty side this could be an amazing dress on . this one had to go back"
__label__0 "this vest was of excellent weight but it had very little style . it was like a giant piece of felt was cut out with little thought to design or nuance . not for me ."
__label__0 "i ordered the stress in an xl . i usually wear a size 12 in most retailer clothes . the pattern and the flow of the dress is very beautiful but it runs extremely small . also i felt that i was choking . it is better suited for thin women ."
__label__1 "i got the top in green it is very soft and comfy . it does flare out a little if you wear it untucked but looks really cute tucked into jeans or a skirt ."
__label__-1 "loved the design and quality of this suit but the cups seemed huge . i weight 135lbs 5 ' 6 and wear a 34c . i bought a large in this suit because other reviews said it ran small ( normally i wear a size medium ) i did like how it fit everywhere expect the chest . i 'm wondering if the medium will still be too large in the chest and hoping the rest would still fit okay . not sure i want to go through the hassle to exchange and it not fit again ! it 's so cute otherwise and would be perfect if you have a la"
__label__-1 "loved the color and the deshn . but when i put on did not look right . waist was too short and the arms were long ."
__label__0 "in the photo and from far away this top looks more elegant than it truly is . wearing it feels like something better suited for sleeping in . it 's a sweatshirt with the sleeves torn off and raw edges which looks rather cheap and sloppy ."
__label__1 "the material is very soft and the lace has a beautiful design . it looks very elegant and romantic . you will need a racer back bra to wear with it though because of the design of the straps . it is very flowing and i think the cut is flattering . the material in the back is slightly transparent so you might want to wear a tank underneath . overall very pretty and i would highly recommend . ( i purchased the white and yellow version . )"
__label__-1 "i ordered the black & white 00 petite . i 'm 5 ' 2 96 lbs . and i order petite sizes all the time . the length for the size i ordered is about 23 ( on the back from neckline ) which is great for me ; however the length on the sides is way too short . the distance between the armpit on the blouse and the side hem is only 9.25 so my skin shows on the sides all the time when wearing regular jeans . not at all the way it shows on the model . i would order 00 regular length but then the sleeves will b"
__label__-1 "it was huge . material looked good but was too bulky . will be returning it ."
__label__-1 "i opened these when i got them yesterday and immediately tried them on . the knees were totally stretched out and due to the panel at the knee it looked like i had growths popping out between my legs at my knees . someone had received these before me and sent them back after they tried them on or wore them then returned them . they were obviously too small for whoever did that . these never should have been resent to another customer . they are obviously very misshapen . they are going back . on a bet"
__label__1 "i initially ordered a small but found it looked way more oversized then what it should look like even considering the style . ( i was swimming in fabric ! ) i exchanged it for a petite small and it fit perfectly . it goes so well with so many looks and it is going to last a long while in my rotation . looks much better in person too . my only reservation is that unlike the original one i received this one had many threads loose throughout which i clipped and think will be alright but i expected"
__label__1 "i love wearing this pullover with leggings and boots . it 's soft comfortable and loose fitting ."
__label__-1 "i was very excited to receive this dress because of the cute photo . however upon arrival i was completely disappointed . the color is much more drab than the photo . the smudged polkadots were n't attractive . there were many little bumps and pulls in the linen . the dress is super heavy . the pleats around the waist did not lay correctly . and it adds 10 pounds to your hips ! super sad ! i am sending it back ."
__label__0 "this shirt is so cute in the picture but not so great in person . i bought the short sleeve version this summer and loved it ! this runs really big so maybe a smaller size will help ."
__label__1 "as the previous reviewer mentioned this dress is great for a dress that does n't have a true waist . it really fits awesome . so incredibly soft high quality material and the mesh pockets are perfection ( pockets that are so small/light that you ca n't tell the dress even had them when looking at it ! ) . the color of the dress is what initially drew me to it ( definitely a different color for a sun dress ) and after trying it on in stores i would say 'beware . ' though it truly is a rich and different c"
__label__1 "i am in love with this dress . ordered online in both my usual 4 and 6 ( i go back and forth ) and this time i kept the six . there is a little bit of stretch to the fabric but it has nice structure and the cap sleeves make it a welcome addition to my wardrobe . i plan on wearing this as a day-to-night dress since it 's appropriate for work and for an evening out ."
__label__-1 "cute but very itchy ! have to wear a long sleeve tee underneath !"
__label__1 "great transition into fall . super soft and comfy . great yellow without being too yellow love it ."
__label__1 "i think the orange top will look great in the fall as well as spring . i 'm 5 ' 7.5 and it 's a great tunic length on me . it 's really pretty and i love it . snap it up on sale !"
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan . unfortunately however i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach . the chest fit well - though it was very low cut - but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger . the quality seemed okay but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long ."
__label__0 "i ordered this sweater in xxsp and the sweater is still very large on me . it is definitely a sweater that is supposed to hang off of your shoulders however i 'm finding that it wants to fall all the way off of me . the quality is nice . it is medium in weight . it has a cottony feeling but it not super soft . it looks way better on the model shown than in person to me . i wanted to love it but i only just like it . i think others will like this if you are looking for a fun loose look in a sweater ."
__label__0 "i expected this dress to be a much better fit and quality overall -- the size small fit me fine -- i 'm about 140 and small in the chest but the zipper was incredibly cheap and the dress could 've draped in a more attractive way . if this dress could be in cotton and given more consideration to the fit and drape it 'd be worth it but it 's going back ."
__label__0 "i love natural colors and nature themes but this top was a disappointment . i ordered both the small and the xs because retailer can run very large . the small was too big and the xs did not hang correctly the arms hit at a weird spot and the neckline would n't sit right . overall the fit was boxy and unflattering . the fabric is pretty but the style is well .... boring . there was just no wow factor for me . i think the fabric deserved a much better design . imho i think this top might be better suited fo"
__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress as it seemed perfect for spring and summer but it just did n't work for me . it made me feel a bit frumpy honestly . i purchased the neutral color . maybe the red would have been less ... grandmotherly . something about the elastic waist just did n't work for me either . i tried this with boots booties heels clogs flats sandals and i just could n't make this dress work . sadly sending this one back . i 'm 5 ' 7 140 lbs and tried the medium ."
__label__-1 "this jacket was cute however i am normally a large with a bit of room to spare . this has the irritating issue of not fitting under the arms and across the chest and shoulders . it is not my shape as most other brands at retailer fit me . this jacket is not sized correctly ."
__label__-1 "i had high hopes with the other positive reviews but it did n't work on me . nice stretchy fabric and nice length but it was bunchy in the front and did n't lay well and did n't do my bust any favors . maybe better on those less pear shaped . hopeless on me ."
__label__0 "the fabric is nice and could pass for silk even though it is viscose-rayon . the pattern is pretty and flattering . sadly the fit was just off- big in the center but tight at the hips . if i size up the v-neck might be too wide . i 'm disappointed that i 'll have to return it . it probably would look great on a different body type . i would recommend it for apple body types but not for pear body types ."
__label__-1 "quality jumpsuit but poor design . the green made me look a bit like gumby the cartoon character"
__label__-1 "i bought this top in two colors -- i think it 's a really cute easy top to wear but the fabric is extremely thin and poor quality . i tucked the front into a pair of shorts and i can already see a small snag forming which i 'm sure will be a hole in no time . two stars only because i really do like the look of the top generally i just wish it was something that was going to last beyond a couple of wears ."
__label__1 "i love that his blazer is soft and not so structured . so great for a business casual environment . the gray goes with everything and is already a staple in my wardrobe ."
__label__0 "the kimono is as pictured . the colors are true to what is shown on line though the description indicates green multi -- it is not green . i returned the item however . the quality is fine but it seemed extremely over-priced to me . it seems to me that half the price would be fair for the quality ."
__label__-1 "the dress was just too ill fitting and bulky and large . it was more matronly looking then anything and did not fit well . if you are going to try it probably size down 2 sizes . for reference i 'm 5 ' 4 and 124 lbs . i bought my normal size 4 and it was very large . i would not recommend as it 's just not flattering . i love one shoulder dresses and tops so was very disappointed as i 'm an retailer devotee ...."
__label__1 "i saw this piece and fell in love with it . the print is beautiful and is well placed on every piece ! it is a little boxy and is a bit warm for indoors but it is unusual enough to overlook the flaws . i am 5'10 . usually a small but sized up to a medium with this one ."
__label__-1 "at first i was taken by the beautiful lacework and the pictures online showing what appeared to be a loose but shaped silhouette . the pictures must have been staged with pins in the back because in person the shirt fits like a circus tent . without exaggeration there is a surplus of about 16 inches . the material is still beautiful . and because of that i have n't decided whether i 'll return this shirt or try cutting out some excess fabric to create a cleaner more fitted shape ."
__label__1 "this dress is extremely body conscious . so if you want to make an impression wear this dress . the fabric is thick and best worn on a cooler night . the pattern is gorgeously done pieced together like a garment three times the cost . the cut of the armholes might not be flattering on those with broad shoulders or chubby upper arms ( like myself ) . for me this dress is tts but way too long so i will have to hem ."
__label__0 "this may be lovely on some people but it did n't work on me at all . i thought it would have some swing to it but the bottom hem was tight . if i had gone up a size the top would have been huge . the bib was n't flattering on me and it 's also quite sheer . too bad because the print is great . maybe if you 're athletic with slim hips you can manage it . i think if you are busty this could look like maternity wear on you . back it went sadly ."
__label__1 "beautiful skirt but does run small . i wear a small and am able to keep the skirt but have to be very careful about under garments since it is so tight . looks great though ."
__label__1 "this top is gorgeous in person ! i 'm in love with it ! it 's perfect for the holiday season . it runs a little big and long so i suggest going down a size for a more tailored fit ."
__label__1 "i liked this coat but my family said it looked too much like something hilary clinton would wear . i am 54 and i think it made me look a bit dowdy since it runs a bit big ."
__label__-1 "i ordered a small and the top part was huge yet the bottom a little snug . you need a big chest and small legs and bottom . too bad . it 's very cute ."
__label__-1 "i could n't wait to get this top in the mail since they did n't have it at my local retailer but i was so disappointed in both the quality and fit . the white is completely see-thru i ca n't believe how sheer the material is - especially for the price . even as the shirt is lying down i can see through both layers of it ... the fit runs small and short ."
__label__-1 "loved loved loved the shirt but ... the material was so thin"
__label__0 "i was really hoping that this dress would fit perfectly because it looks beautiful on the model ! however when i put the dress on there is a seam where the top portion meets the bottom portion and it made the skirt stick out a ton . i ordered the 0p and i am 5 ' 4 110lbs . maybe ordering this dress in a larger size would prevent the skirt from looking so full at the top ."
__label__-1 "dress is nice but ca n't be worn without tights or you are at a risk of indecently exposing yourself . it is around 30 in length so is more of a tunic than a dress . i 'm only 5 ' 1 and it was too short . ca n't imagine anyone taller even trying to wear this !"
__label__-1 "the skirt is comfortable and as pictured . it also ran tts . i 'm 5 ' 5 tall and weigh 140 lbs . i had the medium and did n't need to size up to a large . when you put the skirt on a normal body it looks like you are wearing an easter egg ... and not in a good way ."
__label__0 "i am 5 ' 2 and i typically wear a 2 or a 2p . lately i 've been finding that petite is just a little too short to wear with wedges so i often order a 2 as i did in this dress . it fits well and it 's flattering . my two complaints are that it gets wrinkly fast and looks sloppy . yes linen is a wrinkly look and that 's normal for linen but somehow this dress just looks sloppy to me . more importantly while wearing for the first time i realized that the seams on the side were very lightly sewn and there"
__label__0 "the colors are beautiful and the fabric is very soft and comfortable . i will be returning because of issues with length and being low cut . for reference i am 5 ' 5 145lbs 38-30-40 34ddd . the dress was low cut and showed too much cleavage for my comfort but this may not be an issue for women with smaller breasts ( or if you do n't mind some cleavage showing ) . this length was also a bit too long so if you are 5 ' 5 or shorter you may want to order the petite size ."
__label__0 "i like the fabric - very smooth and feels nice on the skin . i like the handkerchief hemline too.i did n't realize how much i would not like the neckline . it feels too tight and too high to me and i 'm not sure i could wear this for long without pulling at the neck . also the fit is loose maybe a bit too loose for my taste . but it 's the neck fit that makes me have to return this dress ."
__label__1 "in truth it looks better in the photo . i am sure it was a great value for the money i spent . however i am keeping it because it will match perfectly with a pair of satin pants i want to wear to holiday parties ."
__label__0 "i love the look of this dress and the material - the problem is that when i tried it on the fit was a bit off . it seems that the arm holes hung down way too much and pulled the dress so it is uncomfortable to wear . i do n't think i could have gone down or up a size to make this dress work . it is a shame because i really liked the look of it ."
__label__0 "my girlfriend and i both purchased these leggings in grey . we love the color because it goes with so many things.the problem is they do not fit the same . hers ran true to size and mine ran small . i am tempted to reorder another pair to see if they fit differently ."
__label__-1 "fits like a maternity top . not for my age group or build ."
__label__0 "i am sure these pants are right for someone just not me . i am wider in the hips and they just were really unflatering . the fabric is very lightweight which i was n't expecting and so while the pleats are interesting with my hips they ended up hitting in just the wrong place . the waist was also much lower than i expected -- not low rise but i 'm used to thinking high waist with wide legs . in short these pants are probably great on some body types just not mine . also very long . i 'm 5-8 and a"
__label__1 "found this jumpsuit in standard size small/red motif ( pictures do n't do it justice ) in-store and to my surprise it actually fit ! of course it was billowy since i 'm short/ 113lbs . and it came all the way down to the bottom of my ankles where they meet my feet which i do n't mind . i love that it almost looks like a maxi dress when on . the smocked bodice was snug for a size small so there is a little bit of skin bubbling out in the chest area/near my armpits .. like normal women usually have . ladi"
__label__1 "love these ! so comfy and a great color ! also love that it came in petite ! it is so hard to find avoid crop pant in petite ! ! !"
__label__0 "the fabric is great quality but it stretches too much around the waist making it look a little awkward . other than that the quality is good ."
__label__0 "i kept this top only because i needed a plain black tank but there is nothing special about it . i found it a bit large and thin cheap material ."
__label__0 "i stalked this blouse and when the price dropped i pounced on the black . sadly it did nothing for me . i 'm a large sometimes medium but decided on the large . you 'd think it came with its own cami at this price but no . completely sheer . unwearable without one . the lace is nothing special . the collar is wider in the back uncomfortable and pulls on the lace in the front . the high/low hem fit me oddly in the back . i 'm returning this one ."
__label__1 "nice fabric and cute design . a little low cut ."
__label__-1 "i had been eyeing this coat for a few weeks after it appeared in the email and i finally decided to purchase it to treat myself . i was very excited to get it as it is a beautiful coat online . however once i received it i was very disappointed . the material is much thinner than i would expect for something that cost $ 168 and when i went to button it the button slipped right off the thread it was sewn onto the coat with . i checked the other buttons and all of them were loose as well . perso"
__label__1 "i love this top ! i ordered the print and it will go perfectly with blue or white jeans and even coral shorts . very flattering . i did go up a size ( from xs to s ) based on other reviews and i 'm glad i did . the larger size fits perfectly at the bust and falls just below the hip ."
__label__1 "this yellow/mango color is so beautiful in person . i actually do n't have the best skin tone for shades of yellow but i could n't resist trying this one on & it turned out to be perfect ! the silhouette is very feminine especially around the neckline & shoulders . there is a lot of fabric but i actually appreciate that the dress is substantive . finally the nicest thing is that the dress can easily be dressed up or dressed down depending on how you accessorize it . looking forward to summer !"
__label__1 "i get so many compliments every time i wear this dress . friends strangers younger older and even the pharmacist at my drugstore wanted to know where i bought the dress . it has a 70 's vibe to it fun and swingy . perfect for fall in florida with sandals or when it gets cooler i think it will look great with leggings and boots . i purchased the orange and dark gray in a medium petite ( i 'm 5 ' 4 ' and 135 ) and it hit just above my knee . my favorite dress right now !"
__label__1 "i 'm keeping this dress but it 's going straight to the dry cleaner because right out of the bag it has a very strong chemical smell ... like it had been stored in a gas station . then i 'm replacing all the buttons . the fabric is a thick eyelet folded over with these teeny thin shell buttons that are a complete design fail . two were broken right out of the package . also i 'm a size 0 in most retailer dresses and this dress has plenty of room in the waist almost too much space but the top ... i hav"
__label__1 "this dress is even better in person . the base color of the fabric is a very light peach and very lovely . as you can see from the photos the green floral pattern running up the front of the dress varies slightly from dress to dress but i found the front on mine was very similar to the 1st photo . the bright green flowers are a light mint green which plays beautifully with the light peach . there are more details in the print to discover in person which is a nice bonus . the silk is not stiff li"
__label__0 "i loved the fabric cut and style of these shirts the diamond gather in the front is a problem though . i just went under and snipped the elastic that is sewn on that design to relax it a bit . this shirt washes and wears wonderfully . please make again maybe fix the diamond area so it is not sewn with as much continuous elastic a space in the sewing on both sides would alleviate that pucker . sill i love this top"
__label__-1 "the dresss is much shorter than described . very see thru though guess you can tell from picture . expected more for the price ."
__label__-1 "i 'm 5 ' 5 and 140 lbs - hardly super-tiny and the xs was swimming on me . the shoulders are oddly large and this beautiful sweater/jacket just hangs off the body . believe it when they say oversized styling - unfortunately will have to return ."
__label__0 "great colors and not too voluminous . lined whig will be great for fall but the downsides are the huge elastic waist bc it 'll require a belt or something over it ( looks v casual alone ) and even with a perfect fit it gives a bit of muffin just bc it 's a huge piece of elastic . i 've literally tried this on on two occasions trying to convince myself it it . lol but it 's not worth it at the current price ."
__label__1 "i just bought this top in size medium and i love it . super comfortable and flowy . if you want to dry it in the machine just put cold air and it wo n't shrink . do n't use hot air ..."
__label__1 "the shirt was better than it actually looked online . the only downfall was that there was a pulled thread on the shirt when i received it . it 's something i can probably fix just a little disappointed receiving in that shape . i would recommend this top . very flattering and dressy if you want it to be ."
__label__1 "i was n't sure how to rate the fit on these . i tried my normal 12 and the waist fit pretty well- but there 's a lot of room in the hip/pelvis area . i tried a 10 but the waist did n't fit . i can see these gathering when i sit- but i just love the print . there is no stretch in these either . i have slim legs- if you do n't i would size up or just pass . the calf is tight ."
__label__0 "i wish i could keep this dress based on the pretty orange print and style but the fabric and details make this a return even on sale price : ( agree with previous reviews : bodice too tight neckline too high/chokes fabric is rough outer is poorly attached to liner so it poofs in weird areas . too bad ... so sad !"
__label__0 "material is nice . design would be so great if it did n't fit so large ! i am 5 ' 4 118lbs athletic build . the dress could be belted i think ( a very slim girl at retailer did this ) but it is not worth $ 158 in my opinion . if on sale i might keep it due to the hastle of returning it however it is not flowy . it fits okay in the shoulders almost too loose and the rest looks like a potato sack . so disappointed ! !"
__label__1 "i absolutely love this pullover and am so glad i purchased it . it is the perfect weight for fall/winter super soft true to size . the diamond shape opening in back looks great with my strappy yoga bras i have received compliments every time i wear it . i am 6 ' 144lb slim/athletic build and often have trouble with sleeve length . this however is perfect & i can use the thumb holes as designed without stretching the sleeves in an awkward way . wish it came in more colors !"
__label__1 "i ordered one size down and it 's still plenty roomy . as others have said the sleeves are a tighter fit but there is a tiny bit of stretch to the fabric . i 'm smaller busted and did n't want the v-neck to get too low so i sized down one . very cute tucked into jeans or paired with leggings ."
__label__0 "i so wanted to like these pants . i wear a lot of genie pants because they 're comfortable . the problem with these is that they 're too narrow towards the ankle but the worst is the fabric . its old lady fabric . i was hoping for a pair of blousy joggers in a light denim and this fabric was disgraceful . i knew the minute i saw them that they were going back . i 'll keep looking and hoping ."
__label__1 "super cute and simple shirt ( as other reviewer said lol ) . but she was right ! i have another shirt from this brand and it 's one of my favorites . it runs true to size . it 's a nice casual wear with jeans kind of shirt and great for fall . it may be a little short for someone with a long torso and/or tall as i 'm only 5 ' 2 and i would n't want it to be any shorter ."
__label__0 "i liked the look of the tunic sweater and it was very soft . i am 5 ' 7 115 lbs and tried on the xs . the arms felt a bit tight but overall it fit well and i liked the length . i did not like how high the hem was split though- i would ideally like to wear these with a pair of leggings and wish the hem was split just a little lower and not right at my hip . the material was very soft but i felt like it was a bit cheap for the price ."
__label__-1 "just wanted to review so people know this hoodie has a zipper . it 's very soft and comfy but i was looking for a pullover hoodie and am disappointed that once again retailer 's picture does n't match the actual product . it does fit true to size however ."
__label__1 "i really like this top ! it 's lightweight great quality and i 've worn it for casual weekend outings and also dressed up for work ."
__label__0 "i only tried on the ivory one but it was so see-through there was just no way . i ca n't speak for the other colors . seemed true to size maybe a little large but that 's the style . very cute design loved the back . too bad ."
__label__1 "i am normally a size 4/6p in all things retailer but read the reviews and opted to go petite on the maxi and size up . i went with the 8p and even with a 32d bust had no trouble zipping and it fit beautifully . the band is a tad loose but any tighter would n't have fit in the bust . this dress hangs beautifully and is incredibly flattering especially for those of us with an athletic build ."
__label__-1 "as soon as i saw this dress online i loved it and ordered it ! unfortunately it just did n't work for me i tried it in a small medium and large . for reference i 'm 5 ' 2 145lbs 36d . the dress is really pretty in person but i looked like a little girl in it . my daughter who is 4 ' 9 100lbs 34a also tried it on and she too looked like a little girl in it . the material is beautiful along with the detail at the neckline however the neckline is not open like in the picture it 's more pushed toget"
__label__-1 "i was expecting elbow-to-full-length sleeves and like a previous review noted they were short . very weird look for a wrap . returned ."
__label__-1 "if these jeans work for you you 're a lucky girl ! the fabric is really thick and soft . pocket detail is cool and the hidden multicolored button placket is a nice detail . i ordered down a size . they 're tight across my thighs and seem shorter than a 30 inseam . the fit is boxy and not flattering on me but pants are so cute i may keep them anyway ."
__label__0 "bought in white . it has a ribbed detail that makes ir only for casual wear . the white is pretty sheer . will return ."
__label__1 "beautiful and very versatile dress . extremely forgiving for post baby bodies while stylish and classy ."
__label__-1 "i waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed . loved the skirt part of it . but the top which i guess i did n't see in photo was pleated as well made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides . would have been a wonderful summer dress flowing and cool ."
__label__-1 "huge with bountiful amounts of extra fullness .... not like represented picture . and it snags very easily . i have a 4 mo . old puppy that jumped up on me as i was trying it on and snagged it in several places . ' i 'm going to see about returning it with the snags ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this dress . i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors and thought that the green color would be perfect . it is well made but the fabric is lighter than expected . the biggest issues was the size . i am 5 ' 7 and typically a size ten . i ordered the ten and it fit like a 14-16. it was huge . if you order this i would say size down two sizes ."
__label__1 "it 's very pretty . i purchased mine in the floral . romantic floral . the peplum is true to photos . it is n't short as many are . the print is gorgeous and the fabric is soft and comfortable and the styling is perfect"
__label__-1 "the fabric and cut of this blouse are beautiful but the v was so deep i could never wear it without a cami and i think that would ruin the look . i have a large chest but the similarly cut blouse ( without the textured fabric - from the same designer ) fit me fine . this one is just cut differently . i even tried sizing up and down - to no avail . the photo on the model seems misleading because i do n't see how the neck would lay flat or stay that high on anyone - even with a smaller chest . i was so"
__label__0 "ordered navy in a medium and it is wide . sometimes that 's a good thing but not this time . am short waisted and hoped this would be more fitted at the waist on me but it is n't . it just looked frumpy with lots of see through parts . obviously it needs a cami but was n't attractive on me at all . seemed well made and probably better on someone taller ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this shirt . it 's not my usual style buy it looked so great online . unfortunately the actual shirt is much more brown in color and design than i thought looking online . i 'm fair coloring & it just was n't flattering . i 'm thin but have a larger chest and this style just was n't right for me . could definitely be cute on someone else but not a good match for me ."
__label__1 "great dress that is very flattering . works well with flats or can be dressed up with heels . perfect for travel because the material does n't wrinkle . would highly recommend this dress !"
__label__-1 "this is quite an odd dress . it does wrap and is beautiful material . however the dress does not close at all in the chest area . i thought perhaps it was meant to be a kimono . it will go back for sure ."
__label__1 "i have been eyeing this top for a couple weeks and finally found it in my store . it was a good sign when i saw our stores in-house stylist wearing it ! i absolutely love the fit -- it 's soft and stretchy and fabric is nice quality . i 'm typically a medium sometimes large -- i bought the medium and it 's perfect . i could have gone down to a small as well . the large was way too big ( for reference i 'm 5 ' 8 athletic 150lbs ) . this top is going to take me everywhere this summer ! worth a try !"
__label__0 "very cute top and nice material but the fit is strange . there 's a reason that the model has her arms at her side . the shoulders fit perfectly in my usual small but the body is very loose . the sleeves are full probably twice as full as seen in the pictures which adds interest but was unexpected . also the arm hole is wide so the bottom seam of the sleeve attaches low on the body of the shirt which creates an awkward silhouette . i normally love designs by whit but i 'm not sure about this one"
__label__-1 "way too long ... the sizing is incredibly off on this product . order a size or two down ."
__label__1 "the print caught my eye . then i felt the breathable cotton fabric and had to try it on . i am only 5 ' 2 '' and have a small waist but sized 32dd bust with hips and have a hard time finding clothes that fit well .. this dress fit me perfectly ! i have dressed it up and down and always get compliments . this dress was on the pricey side but has turned out to be worth every penny ."
__label__1 "what a great top ! i am 5 ' 9 - 136 lbs with a 34d chest .. and this top looks and feels great on . i am usually a 6 and the small fit perfectly . i purchased the grey and it is a nice medium grey color . the v in front hits in a great spot .. not too low but just low enough to look feminine . i have n't washed and dried the top yet so i hope it looks as good after washing as it does brand new . i was hesitant to order because of the earlier reviews but i find this top really works for me so i am glad"
__label__0 "i loved the fit color and style but the fabric seemed very thin and cheap . i was worried that it would tear easily . this is getting returned ."
__label__1 "this dress is extremely flattering on and looks a lot better when worn than on the hanger . the cut drapes very nicely and is true to size . i am 5 feet tall / 95lbs and the xxsp fit perfectly . it is a bit short however so i would caution that it may not be work office appropriate if you are taller . like most hd in paris dresses it is also quite thin although lined . this dress would look lovely with a either delicate jewelry or a bold statement piece and is casual enough for a lunch outing or"
__label__0 "i love the pattern ( red motif ) but the sizing of this dress is way off . the top fit fine but the hip area was so tight when standing with my legs hip-width apart . the only way it looked normal was if i stood with my feet together and thighs touching . i ordered my usual size 10 - for reference i am 5 ' 9 170 # bra size 34f and 40-41 hips ."
__label__1 "i love this dress it 's very comfortable slim swing and very ingratiating . the fabric is light i like the details of the buttons on the sleeves . overall i 'm pleased and happy for the purchase of this dress . i will definitely recommend it ."
__label__-1 "this dress is huge . i am normally a l-xl regular in retailer brands . i love a loose flowy dress . after trying one on in the store ( just a random returned petite xl ) i ordered the petite medium . and it was still huge and not flattering . so sad . i wanted to love this- loved the material and colors but way off ."
__label__0 "i 've been looking for some new casual tops and ordered this one for the sky blue color . i 'm a size 6 and the small fits great . i do n't find the blowzy style overwhelming . i am small boned but i 'm 5 ' 8 not a petite . i like it with leggings and skinny jeans ... a nice proportion . however i can see how this cut may be too much on someone with a smaller frame . i really like it however i see two drawbacks : the material is a bit thin for fall and it wrinkles very easily ( not good for travel ) . this"
__label__0 "i ordered this sweater in green in petite large . the color and knit is beautiful and the shoulders and body fit comfortably ; however the sleeves were very long for a petite . i roll them and it looks okay but would have rather had a normal petite length sleeve ."
__label__0 "i fell in love instantly ... but ... upon looking in the mirror it is 100 percent see through . at least the black is ... i love it enough that i am going to try to put a cami underneath . however that may n't work . the shirt is lovely in and of itself but at 48 i do n't need a see through shirt . it is also defiantly about a size larger that expected . so size down . almost so good !"
__label__1 "great quality and extremely flattering . bonus that it is on sale . i felt like this dress was a godsend . i am five months pregnant and needed a dress that made me feel comfortable but not frumpy . i think i 'll get a lot of mileage out of it as there 's enough stretch to get me through the next few months and then ( hopefully ! ) i can wear it after too . also can be dressed up or down so appropriate for many occasions . i believe it runs true to size ( i sized up from xs to s for obvious reasons but"
__label__1 "this top is sooo cute . it does not look like pajamas as one person said it looks like a top . it 's a bit on the boxy style so anything you want to hide below is well covered . has a nice length to it . is not just for lounging . paired it with a black pencil skirt and it looked great . i ordered the xl ( i am a 40d for reference ) and it hung very nicely . its extremely soft and very comfy . i only wish they had more colors ."
__label__0 "very cute dress just way too big . i ordered it online wish i would have gone a size smaller ."
__label__1 "i really like this dress a lot . the material is soft and comfortable . it is clingy but not in a bad way . the design can camouflage some figure problems . i thought it looked better with a belt so i added a skinny beige/pink belt which worked great . ca n't say enough about how comfortable this dress is ."
__label__-1 "the dress has a partially sewn-in slip which really did n't work for me . no matter how much adjusting i did i could n't get the slip and dress to sit properly . i ordered a medium and if it had n't been for the slip the fit would have been good . the length was as pictured . for reference i am 5 ' 5 145lbs 38-30-40 34ddd ."
__label__0 "a nice comfy sweatshirt . i do wish it was just a tad longer ; tends to run a little short and therefore looks a little boxy and i 'm only 5 ' 3 ! ( i purchased the regular size not the petite ) also the front wool insert is a little scratchy as it is not lined on the inside ."
__label__0 "i agree with those who thought this material looked a little cheap . i ordered the white knowing about the sleeves and thought i 'd like the slits but the material + sleeves definitely gave an undesired pirate vibe . true to size ."
__label__-1 "the front cream panel is completely transparent.i did n't purchase because my bra showed and it would ruin the look with a cami underneath . i wish the fabric were translucent - not so see through ."
__label__0 "the shirt design is very nice but it fits very loose . it will not look good if you are heavier as this shirt will make you look wider because of the baggy fit . the sleeves though are fitted and feel a little tight . the material of the sleeves also is very itchy and feels like some wool material ."
__label__0 "i really thought i would love this dress the style is really nice and the material is great . however the length made me feel like i looked short and kind of stumpy . i feel like this dress would look really good on somebody that is more like 6ft not my 5 ' 6 self ."
__label__0 "this is a shift dress which is a great dress for many people in a kind of man-repeller way . by saying that i mean a really pretty dress that can show off amazing shoes good legs a beautiful face and hair . this is not a body con dress . however when you do such a high neckline and boxy sleeves you do no one any favors . everyone has a nice neck and decolletage and collarbone . everyone . the neckline needs to open up a bit .... i 'm not saying v-neck just a bit lower than this because it makes"
__label__1 "these did n't work for me because i am too straight shaped for these jeans . try them if you have a smaller waist and curvy hips and bottom ! i did n't have anything to fill out the hips and seat . for reference i ordered size 25 and they were loose in hip and seat but fit my waist . my hips are 34.5 and waist is 28. they are a thinner stretch denim than they appear but not jeggings thin ."
__label__0 "loved the style and color/design but this dress was simply too short in the front . the slip was also slightly tight over hips . i wish this was longer !"
__label__1 "i love this blouse . the color is very cheerful with it 's small white polka dot design . i usually wear a medium but went with the large because the shirt is slightly sheer and i will likely wear a cami underneath ."
__label__-1 "this blouse is a disappointment ! it runs so large it looks ridiculous . the cute is super wide and flared . they must have it pinned on the model . it is not flattering at all . i really thought this could be cute . not worth the money either ! it 's expensive and ill-fitting . for reference i am 5 ' 3 and 123lbs and wear a 2 or 4 ."
__label__-1 "the skirt is just okay . the design is great but the material is extremely thin and see through . there is a slip which goes to mid-thigh- very strange and felt weird as well . the pleats are okay but not great . overall it is not worth paying full price for or anywhere near that . and again be wary of it being see through ."
__label__0 "i 'm usually a small ( 5 ' 5 116 lbs long torso ) but the x-small fit well . the black does look see-through in the pictures but i figured i could wear a cami with it . it is see-through in person if you are up close mainly in the back and arms since the front has extra fabric in places . however it is rather short possibly because it is an x-small and i 'll need a short cami to fit under it or will have to have a cami hanging out of the bottom which drapes nicely and a cami may mar that effect"
__label__-1 "i love the fit of these pants -- they 're the perfect slim black pants . however i wore these pants exactly three times before the seams split the middle of the pant in not just one but multiple places . disappointed by the workmanship/quality of the product especially since the pants fit amazingly and do n't sag like other slim fitting black pants tend to do . i hope retailer will take this into consideration and improve the quality of future iterations of this product ."
__label__-1 "i gulped when i put this in my bag during retailer days because the price was still too much but thought this has to be wonderful to charge so much right ? boy was i wrong . this is a sweater knit with a very deep v-neck that 's incredibly boxy and unattractive . the knit shed all over my pants in the few minutes i had it on . i ordered in xl having never tried this designer and that was a mistake because i generally wear large or medium . it was swimming on me . the stripes are n't as cute in real life"
__label__0 "i love these pants . like obsessively love like did n't want to take them off to wash them love . annnnd i wish i had n't because they came out of a delicate cycle cold water wash with a huge part of the leg seam ripped apart like a spider web . maybe i just got a bad pair but i was n't prepared to have to patch them after one wash for the price ."
__label__1 "i wanted a turtleneck for layering with cardigans and vests . i ordered the burgundy color in an xs ( my usual 2 ) and the color is lovely and deep . i absolutely love it . the ribbed design is comfortable . the neck drapes as shown so it is not constricting at all ."
__label__-1 "too big and it 's not secure enough to wear for swimming ."
__label__1 "i was not impressed upon first taking it out of the package it was a wrinkled mess lighter weight than i imagined and i felt like it hung like a potato sack . however after i gave it a good ironing and used the inside back tie to sinch in the waist i was in love . it draped beautiful the blue has beautiful embroidered detail and i love the full length sleeves that can be rolled . i feel iike i will use for many seasons ."
__label__1 "this is an amazing dress . beautiful fabric and color . comfortable too . it 's like wearing air . sorta chameleon like because this print literally goes with anything and looks unforgettable on . it 's slimming too . i got the large and it flows so nicely over my body . the back is completely open . it closes with a tie at the neck and the waist that drapes beautifully and looks great from the side view . the fabric is a bit sheer so i ordered the white cotton slip by this designer which is slightly snu"
__label__-1 "i read the other review that said the shirt was boxy i did n't think it would be a terribly big deal . unfortunately it is . normally i wear a size s so i sized down o an xs . the shirt fits in the sleeves and neckline but the shirt is still very box and now super short . unfortunately this is going back . not a good fit . adorable details but the fit is terrible ."
__label__-1 "let me start off by saying how pretty this top is and heavy .and itchy ! you would have to stand like the model does in the first shot to wear the top ( with your arms not touching any part of the top ! the sequins will itch if you put your arms down ( underneath the armhole ) . another reason i did n't like the top was because the should straps are unadjustable . i would have to get mine tailored for my 5 ' 2 frame . i usually wear a medium or 6/8 in tops and ordered this in a medium it was roomy ."
__label__0 "oh how i wanted this skirt to work .... the fabric - both pattern and color - is beautiful . the style is very nice . the knit is comfortable . but ... the knit was so soft and pliable that it lost its shape right away . after wearing it for an hour the front slit was curling in weird directions . the fabric around the hips got sort of crooked and hang-y . i would have loved the fabric to be one notch more substantial for a more defined waist and better integrity around the hips ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this in a small and medium hoping one would work but the previous reviews were exactly correct the bodice is way too small in proportion to the rest of the jumpsuit . the bottom has lots of fabric which would n't be bad except you have to go up a size to make the bodice fit then the bottom becomes overwhelming . i am 5 ' 5 and 115 so i have a slim build and could n't get the bodice to zip in a small . the medium would have needed altering which would n't have fixed the extra fabric on th"
__label__-1 "i am typically a small/6 in dresses but i should have gone with the other reviewers and sized down . it had no shape but hung like a paper sack . the armholes fit perfectly though if i had sized down they may have been too tight . i am 5 ' 6 140 lb i will return too bad because it is a pretty dress !"
__label__0 "i loved the lavender color on the cape . it was soft and comfortable . but the design on the front ruined it for me . it took me all of 1 minute to know it was going back . it looked like florescent bird feathers nothing wrong with that it just was n't my style at all . i was a bit disappointed as it would have been perfect for cool ca nights . it looked more subdued in the photo it 's not . i clicked i would recommend to others as it is nicely made and i guess just not my taste as far as the colors an"
__label__0 "although the design and quality were great this did not work for me . it was boxy square and overwhelmed my petite frame . if you are taller or have a longer torso this may be a great basic staple for your wardrobe ."
__label__-1 "i bought this shirt immediately because of the pattern when it arrived i was super confused . it 's not a tee shirt like it looks like in the photos . it 's made with cotton fabric with a tiny bit of stretch . i ordered the xl because i have brought shoulders and 36e bras size and it fits like a 2x or larger . i would say order two sizes down . also it hangs like a maternity shirt . i might order it once it 's on sale which it definitely will be but even then am not positive i would keep it ."
__label__-1 "i loved this dress before putting it on but it was just not the right cut or style for my body type . it is very roomy and full and looked like a maternity dress which was not a look i was going for . sadly this will be going back . i loved the print and the feel of the material . just not a flattering cut for me ."
__label__1 "this dress is everything . i 'm 5 ' 4 athletic build 36d and the medium fit me perfectly . the colors are really understated and beautiful and can easily be dressed up or down . i wish the elastic around the waist fell a little lower but that 's one of those things only i notice and definitely did n't keep me from falling in love and buying it . ca n't wait to wear it on vacation next week !"
__label__-1 "i loved this dress . it fit perfectly everywhere except for the sleeves . the dress has an overall relaxed fit but the sleeves were way too tight . i had to send back because of sleeves ."
__label__0 "i do n't mind loose-fitting clothing but to say that this product runs large is an understatement . no amount of pulling tying pinching could help me get this jacket to fall the way it does on the model in the photo . the arm holes are a foot in diameter for artistic purposes and the jacket itself is meant to flow far away from the body i guess . if you try to taper it in with the strings then end result resembles a rounded beach ball . very disappointed especially since the design on the fabr"
__label__-1 "i was really disappointed when i tried this top on . the design and cut of the neckline is very bulky and just off . the cut of the top overall was just off ."
__label__-1 "i love this dress as far as the fit goes . it makes my curvy figure loook even better with how it 's cut . that being said the different patterns over each boob made the dress look crazy . it makes you look quite lopsided in the chest . was n't just me but my store people also agreed . had the pattern on the chest been the same it would be great but even though my boobs are of mostly equal size they looked too crazy . it 's quite noticeable on . so sad : ("
__label__-1 "i 'm 5'-4 130lbs with a 32f chest . this dress looked like a cross between little house on the prairie and a mu mu . i ca n't imagine this looking good on anyone who is n't 7 ' tall . also the straight across rather high neck line was n't flattering to a large chest and then the arm holes are huge . the fabric was a bit shiny and felt cheap . it was n't see through but it had the feel of a nightgown not a hundred dollar dress ."
__label__1 "simply lovely to look at because of the fringe detail and it 's a joy to wear because it does not cling to my trouble spots . very versatile as it can be worn and layered in many different ways . i was lucky enough to buy this in petite but i 'm sure the regular would 've been fine . looking forward to outfitting this because i got so much inspiration from instagram ."
__label__0 "this top has too much fabric ! i would of liked it more if they had a smaller size but the small seemed like a medium or large !"
__label__0 "despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it . i 'm typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small . the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i 'd said for more for a b . ( if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it ) a final comment on this suit - it looked like there were these little sticky spots all over the suit like stickers had been removed . it was reticketed and it did n't really feel brand new when it arrived"
__label__1 "these jeans are great . the rise is perfect ."
__label__1 "the colors are beautiful on this shirt and it is true to size . it is very comfortable but i wish the flowing part on top was pinned under arms or something . it is attached at the top of the tank top but nowhere else so it just kind of lays over the tank with a poncho look.i also think the top layer would look better if it was longer- it hits at my natural waist and i 'm petite . i still plan on keeping it and think it will be cute enough with jeans . just really wanted to love it !"
__label__0 "as other reviewers have noted the fit of this tee is very boxy . it looks okay tucked-in to high waisted jeans but otherwise is unflattering . also the color is described as black but mine looks like a navy blue in person . i kept the shirt because i live overseas and returning it would have been difficult but if able to i would have returned it ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this dress but it just did n't fit in anyway . i ordered an xs petite and it was very large . the lacing in the back is completely useless and that 's what i liked about the dress . i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top ( because of chest ) and then lace more tightly near the waist . it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering . beautiful fabric great color combo bad fit ."
__label__0 "i ordered a m as the previous review said it ran small . i found it to be very large . i have more curves than the model and also thought it made me look boxy ."
__label__0 "very pretty dress and nicely made ( the embroidery is quite lovely and double lining as mentioned by the other reviewers is awesome ) but not a good shape for me and my hourglass figure . like a lot of swing dresses it has no structure and it 's not a good look on someone a little busty as i am . in all honesty i thought the sack-like shape of the dress made me look 20 lbs heavier than i am . i am a medium size 6-8 and took the 8 based on the other reviews . i probably could have sized down to"
__label__1 "unlike other reviews i find this top to run true to size . for reference i 'm 5 ' 3 117 lbs 34 b cup and took an xs . top fits comfortably no tightness around the chest and sleeves ' fullness is n't overwhelming . the lace is see through so a cami is a must . top is of excellent quality and craftsmanship . i have not laundered it yet so i ca n't comment on that . so happy with my purchase ! a keeper for sure ! !"
__label__1 "this skirt is a must have ! ! it is very classy and the pockets are perfect for holding lipstick for a little refresher throughout the night . it is high quality and definitely worth the price . i paired this skirt with a more casual black top and some pearls for a fancy banquet dinner and got a lot of compliments . comfortable and classy ."
__label__-1 "i thought it was going to be so pretty . it is ugly on . the macrame is thick stiff and rough . the top fits awkward on top where the macrame is and the rest is shapeless . yuk !"
__label__1 "i 'm petite and pear shaped so i 'm small on top and curvy around the hips and love the way this dress fits . it 's a relaxed fit so it 's not super fitted and it 's loose around the waist which is great . it 's a wonderful casual dress to wear with a pair of tall boots . i adore it !"
__label__0 "great summer skirt can be dressed up or down . the band top is weird but you do n't have to style it as pictured . i may get the top hemmed down the road . i have a 32 waist and got a size large ."
__label__1 "this dress is stunning . i have been stopped in the street by people asking where the dress is from . my only complaint is that it was very wrinkled when i bought it . initially i thought it was supposed to be that way but after seeing the stock photos i realized it needed to be ironed . it took a long time to iron all of the wrinkles out but it is totally worth it ."
__label__-1 "the sweater runs large the sweater is designed in such a way that it looks very sloppy . i would never be able to wear it out of the house . however the material is exceptionally soft and delightful . keeping as its a great stay at home & lounge sweater but way over priced for this purpose . if you can get the fabric to lay correctly you 're a genius ."
__label__-1 "i buy almost ever top tiny puts out and so i grabbed this one in the last tops sale since i 'm a sucker for embroidered flowers . everything about it is gorgeous except it is so flimsy i ca n't even believe it . like when i held it up in the dressing room i could see through the entire shirt front to back before even putting it on . once on i could see everything through it . i actually thought i was going to tear the thing to pieces trying it on it 's so frail . i own so many tiny shirts and while"
__label__-1 "ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box . tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist . within minutes of wearing the waist fell down past my hips ... glad i was at home . looks cute but will not stay up ."
__label__-1 "beautiful floral print and while i like the concept of this dress it was a total failure for me . where the knit meets the print hit me at the top of my bust truly a disastrous look for a bustier figure since the fabric just drapes down and made me look much larger than i actually am . same with the arms if the white knit had carried down to the elbow it would have elongated the arms instead of cutting them off mid biceps to make them look like giant hams . i 'm 5 ' 6 and a classic size 8 and this"
__label__0 "i suppose i would have kept this top i had n't been misled about the color . i do n't like ecru or eggshell -- the description said it was black and white ."
__label__0 "got this on sale in black and red and have only worn the black . quality is poor seems to stretch out over the course of the day and loses its shape somewhat . a smaller size may keep its shape better so you may want to size down . not worth full price ."
__label__1 "as the other reviewers stated it does run large i sized down 1 size and it 's perfect . great dress to wear so many ways ."
__label__-1 "i love baseball tees and this looked like a more refined version but it was huge and shapeless . nice material and fabric but this one is going back ."
__label__0 "i purchased this shirt online . i thought it would be perfect for work but when i tried it on i could n't even button half the buttons . it is also extremely see-through and even a nude or white cami underneath would look really odd . need to return unfortunately . if the top came in other colors i would return for a larger size but i ca n't deal with see-through work tops ."
__label__0 "i was so excited to get this top ! i love the bow at the neck and the frill sleeves so current . unfortunately it was difficult for me to pull it over my head ! the neck opening is too small and there are no buttons . i have a pretty small head and very fine straight hair so i can imagine that others will have a similar issue getting it on ! i am keeping it because i love the style but will need to alter the neck myself . the rest of the top fits just a bit loose . i got the x-small and am a 3"
__label__1 "i am a shopper .... i shop a lot . this is one of my favorite dresses of all time ! so unique and as others have said like a piece of art ! the fit is tight through the middle but that 's what makes it look so perfect . i wore with tall brown suede boots and got compliments from ken and women alike . i love it !"
__label__-1 "weave on the sweater quite open and easily snags . the first day i wore it the seam on the sleeve began to unravel . needed to use a crochet hook to reweave after the first wearing . not confident that it will hold up well to its first wash ."
__label__-1 "sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is . i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life . this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style . another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $ 5.00 ! ! !"
__label__1 "i really loved the uniqueness of this dress and i was hoping to be able to wear it to work but it was just a little too fitted for the office !"
__label__0 "i bought the orange color . i had a hard time styling it as it is so long . since it is a turtleneck and short sleeve you 'll need a jacket or sweater on top . nothing looked right . it has a relatively high and tight neck so sweaters looked weird . short jackets did n't work either . i 'm 5 ' 4 and bought the small . returned it for the charente cowl neck which worked much better"
__label__-1 "i ordered a size small . i am 5 ' 7 size 6 and the dress was a mini on me ! way shorter than on the taller model . the stomach and hips gaped out from my body yet the waist was cut way too high so the dress was both too small and too big ! very odd fit . the material is soft thick stretchy and has a textured pattern which i liked . this one is going back ."
__label__0 "although the fabric and color is beautiful the sleeves do not lay properly . they are too stiff and look like wings on me . sadly i must return . the quality looks great . it is unfortunate that the design was a miss ."
__label__0 "i love this top and the beading is beautiful but just like everyone else it was way too large . i normally wear a lg but the large looks and feels like a 3xl . beautiful but large"

__label__1 "i love the contemporary style of this piece but i returned it because the side slits were too high even for a short person like me ( 5 ' 1 ) . but if you do n't mind showing a little skin at the waist when you raise your arms it might work for you . the fabric has a nice texture and the muted colors would mix well with other pieces ."

__label__1 "i read the reviews prior to purchasing but loved the pattern so much i had to have it . i was not disappointed however had i not read the reviews i would have been . it is true the top of the dress is flat and does not have the detail as shown on the model . it also appears to be disproportionate . i am 5 ' 1 and curvy the bottom fits well but the top is large however rectified by wearing a padded bra . since i ordered the petite i was surprised the dress was above the ankle ( usually their items are l"
__label__1 "this dress is so pretty ! ! the second i saw it i knew i had to have it . make sure to get a smaller size because it can be a little big towards the waist as a result of the dress ' design ."
__label__1 "this dress intrigued me a bit online but not enough to order it to try it . even on the rack i was n't so sure about it but decided to try it this afternoon . i could n't have been more pleased . it is fresh flattering flowy light and beautiful . even though there is quite a bit of fabric the vertical stripes and nipped in waist make it extremely flattering . i did n't realize this came in blue as well . i may add that one to my wishlist but the red one is a definite winner . it will make a great"
__label__0 "love these pants . ordered in petite . love style great fit but so long . keeping but have to get hemmed 2 1/2 inches . decided to order the black & green as well ."
__label__1 "i was unsure about the color when i got it in the mail but it is very flattering . it is roomy for sure . with a pair of slim shorts or pants it looks great though . creasing may be an issue . 5ft 6 135 lbs 36 d ... the xs looks good with room to spare . nice weight fabric for fall ."
__label__-1 "as much as i wanted to love this top it was too flowy and and i felt like i looked bigger than i am ( i 'm a size 6 ) . maybe a smaller size would have made a big difference ."
__label__1 "i 've got the post-baby bulge and this dress makes me the hottest i 've looked in a long time ! fitted but skimming where i do n't want to be accentuated - it 's a rare dress that can pull this off ! the cleavage is there so i think it 's more of a night dress but i 'd wear it with a sweater during the day . very comfortable ."
__label__0 "i look like a stuffed sausage in these pants and i even went up a size . for some reason this fabric is n't working for me . i think it 's the sheed combined with the stretch ( or lack there of ) of the fabric . i 'll have to pass ."
__label__-1 "the pattern and fabric are lovely but the sleeves are short ( unlike the photo ) so it drapes very strangely . i personally could not figure out how to wear it so that it looked anything remotely like the photo . had to return this one ."
__label__0 "i wanted so badly for this dress to work on me . the design is amazing . the detail is so pretty and delicate . its my version of the perfect little black dress ! however i have very big arms ... and while i could have easily sized down for the body of the dress the arms and chest in my normal size did not fit at all . i 'm usually a 14-16 in dresses . i tried the 16 and it just did n't work . the arms were way too tight . however i 've seen this dress on many other women with smaller arms than me and they"
__label__0 "the fit is slightly loose but figure flattering the fabric is semi sheer and the light coral color is very pretty . however after one short wear i discovered fabric torn from both sides of the back seam . unfortunately i need to return this blouse asap ."
__label__0 "i have to say being a silk lover decision was hard to make . the quality is phenomenal . i do agree to a reviewer that said it 's pj like . i tried it with belt did n't help much with the look somehow . it just felt empty . my daughter who i usually turn for opinions said ewww grandma ... i know truth hurts . i ca n't exchange for a smaller size either because the fabric is not stretchy and i 'm afraid the extra small would confine my arm movement . on top of that the background is more peachy tha"
__label__1 "i absolutely love this jacket . as a 36 year old woman i want items that are on trend but do n't look juvenile . this jacket hits the nail on the head for me ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this online and when i opened the package i was impressed with the quality of the material and stitching for this top . it is much nicer than a basic t-shirt . when i tried this on the band of stitching that was supposed to go beneath my chest was sitting on top of my cleavage ! also the overall length is listed as 27 long but i think that is the back of the shirt . the front of the shirt is very short on me ( i 'm 5'10 ) hitting well above my hip bones . if only this was much m"
__label__1 "love this shirt . tried it on in 2 of the colors and both were very flattering . the quality of the shirt is great . worth the price for sure !"
__label__-1 "i was obsessed with this top . i ordered my normal 4 and was bummed about the fit in the shoulders . the slight puff was too far in it did n't hit on my shoulder . so i returned it to a store and ordered a 6. it came quickly but it was still too narrow in the shoulders . i took it to the store and held it against the 4 and the seam was the same length between the neck and shoulder as the 4. both returned . i had no hope for an 8 ."
__label__1 "loved pattern quality and fine details on this dress but it ran large . i ordered petite small and it was way too loose/baggy .i had to return it . i went bsck to order a petite x/small but it was no longer available in this size on- line . so disappointed ! fyi i 'm 5 ' 112-115lbs and small boned -always wear size petite small . but not fir this dress ! this dress is comfortable well made lined and pattern is extremely pretty with nice border ( which is hard to find for petites -a"
